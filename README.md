# Knockout Deck: Subset Learning

## About:
In magic, a knockout deck is one which fools the viewer in to believing that only one deck was used to perform the trick; when in fact, multiple decks were used. That is exactly what this addon does, it misdirects the Anki reviewer to follow the selected deck as the parent deck, but in fact, it is made up of multiple decks from multiple sources. This allows subset learning, or reviewing any deck regardless of their parent-child relationship.

The only catch is that the first selected deck will be designated as the alpha deck. Any parent deck specific options required by addons will come from this deck's config options. Most well written addons will not have a problem with this. Life Drain, for example, uses the selected deck's config options for time settings. So selecting a deck with a specific 5 mins timer configuration will end the game after only 5 mins as oppose to selecting a deck with 25 mins as the alpha deck.


## To use:
Same as all my other addons, click "Study" under menubar and select "Knockout Deck".
